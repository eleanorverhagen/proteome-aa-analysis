# Proteome Amino Acid Analysis

## Amino Acid Comparison Between Full Proteomes and Subsets

This script takes as input a Uniprot proteome and a file containing a subset of Uniprot IDs from the same proteome. 

An example Uniprot proteome file and subset are included as 'sample.fasta' and 'subset.txt', and these can be changed as needed. 

As output the script plots the fractions of cysteines, as well as acid, basic, and hydrophobic amino acids in the whole proteome and in the subset.
