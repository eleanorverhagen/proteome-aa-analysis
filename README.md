# proteome_aa_analysis
Amino Acid Comparison in Full Proteomes and in Subsets

This script takes as input a Uniprot proteome and a file containing a subset of Uniprot IDs from the same proteome. An example subset file is included in the input folder as 'sample.txt'. As output the script plots the fractions of cysteines, as well as acid, basic and hydrophobic amino acids in the whole proteome and in the subset.
