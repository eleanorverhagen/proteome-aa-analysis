# Proteome Amino Acid Analysis

## Amino Acid Comparison in Full Proteomes and in Subsets

This script takes as input a Uniprot proteome and a file containing a subset of Uniprot IDs from the same proteome. 

An example Uniprot proteome file and subset are included as 'sample.fasta' and 'subset.txt', and these can be changed as you see fit. 

As output the script plots the fractions of cysteines, as well as acid, basic, and hydrophobic amino acids in the whole proteome and in the subset.
